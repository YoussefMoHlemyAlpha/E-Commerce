# 🛍️ E-Commerce Platform

This E-Commerce Platform is a modern, scalable web application built using NestJS for the backend, MongoDB for data persistence, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

It provides a complete foundation for any online store, featuring user registration and login, product management, cart and order functionality, and role-based access control.

The backend API is fully RESTful and designed following clean architectural principles — ensuring maintainability, modularity, and high performance.

Built with developer experience in mind, this project showcases how to structure and implement real-world e-commerce logic using NestJS and MongoDB, while keeping security and scalability as top priorities. 🚀
